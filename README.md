DESCRIPTION
Welcome to "Weather in the USA" App. This is a simple JS application designed for kids. It is designed by using this Weather API https://openweathermap.org/current and shows current weather information for a searchable city in the United States.

EXECUTING the APP
1) Navigate into the folder you where you want to place this application
2) git clone https://github.com/CodingNannah/JS_WeatherApp_Project.git
3) cd JS_WeatherApp_Project
Now you are inside the project!

If you would like to clone this application, no additional installations are required.

USING the APP
To use this app, search for a city by city and two-digit state id. If you have forgotten the state id, the "Forgot State ID" button is not working properly, yet. You may right mouse click it to find a list of state ids. Just scroll down the page.

If the blue "Location" area reads "undefined" after clicking the tangerine-colored "Submit" button, your chosen city is not currently in the database. Try again with another city.

Enjoy!
